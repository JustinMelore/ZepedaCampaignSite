                            "Michael Zepeda announced on Tuesday that he is entering the race for Arizona State Treasurer, positioning his campaign 
                            around fiscal responsibility, transparency in state finances, and protecting taxpayers amid ongoing economic uncertainty.<br><br>
                            
                            In a statement released with his announcement, Zepeda said Arizona families and small businesses are facing rising 
                            costs tied to housing, utilities, and everyday expenses, making sound stewardship of public funds more important than ever. 
                            He emphasized that the treasurer’s office plays a critical role in safeguarding state investments, managing billions of 
                            dollars in public assets, and ensuring long-term financial stability."

                            "The new Arizona Independent Party is joining forces with a national group as both organizations attempt to create a viable third party option appealing to moderate and centrist voters.
                            On the heels of a failed effort to create an open primary system, former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson took over the No Labels Party in Arizona and rebranded it as the Arizona Independent Party in October.
                            Now, Johnson is joining forces with the Forward Party, the organization launched four years ago by former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Andrew Yang after the latter’s failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination."

                            "PHOENIX — The political party that had been known as No Labels in Arizona now has a label. The party is now known as the Arizona Independent Party (AIP), according to former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson, who is the party’s chairman.
                            AIP has the third-most registered voters (42,277) in Arizona, trailing only the Democratic (1,269,886) and Republican (1,603,141) parties, according to the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office. 
                            Johnson hopes that number, and the number of candidates the party has on ballots, will soon rise."
