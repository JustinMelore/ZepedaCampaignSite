                <p>
                    The Treasurer's Office shouldn't be a political weapon - it should be a watchdog for taxpayers.
                    I will focus on spending smarter, not more, by cutting waste, priortizing local infrastructure,
                    and invessting in long-term growth that benefits rural and urban Arizona alike.

                <p>
                    Arizona is tired of political theater. I will treat every citizen and every legislator with respect,
                    regardless of party. My focus is results, not rhetoric - because good ideas don't have party lines.

                <p>
                    We can bridge the divides that hold Arizona back by listening to every community and working toward
                    shared goals - stronger schools, thriving businesses, and sustainable water and energy management. Together,
                    we'll build a future that works for all Arizonans, not just one side.
