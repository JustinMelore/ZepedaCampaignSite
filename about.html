        <h1>Who is Michael Zepeda</h1>
        <p>
            My parents came to this country as legal immigrants with very little, but they carried big hopes. They taught my brother and I 
            that <span>education is the key to a better life—and that hard work and honesty still matter.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve spent years teaching middle school and running a small business to help make ends meet. My wife and I work hard every day to take 
            care of our family, <span>just like you do.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, I’ve grown deeply concerned about the direction of our country and how both major parties seem more interested in 
            fighting each other than solving real problems. As a social studies teacher, <span>I’ve always told my students that standing up for what’s 
            right matters—so now, I’m standing up myself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re building a new path—one based on <span>respect, responsibility, and results</span>. I believe you can love people you disagree with. I believe in 
            being conservative with your money. And I believe there’s no greater investment than education.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you give me your support, I’ll be a careful steward of your tax dollars—and I’ll make sure no political party ever comes before you. 
        </p>
