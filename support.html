            <!-- <p>
                Donations are some of the best ways for our supporters to help keep our campaign running. A five dollar contribution is more than enough,
                but if you have the ability and desire to support even further, we can accept up to $220 from individuals. We are not taking money from
                corporation lobbyist PACs, Michael Zepeda is a candidate for the people, and will run through clean and clear elections.
            </p> -->
            <p>
                <span>What Does $5 Buy You?</span> For just $5, you're helping someone who doesn't take money from big companies. You're helping a person who
                doesn't belong to either political party - someone who stands proudly as independent. Most of all, you're supporting someone who will work
                hard to protect you, your family, and your money.
