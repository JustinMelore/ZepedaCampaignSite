            <!-- <p>
                Donations are some of the best ways for our supporters to help keep our campaign running. A five dollar contribution is more than enough,
                but if you have the ability and desire to support even further, we can accept up to $220 from individuals. We are not taking money from
                corporation lobbyist PACs, Michael Zepeda is a candidate for the people, and will run through clean and clear elections.
            </p> -->
            <p>
                <span>What Does $5 Buy You?</span> For just $5, you're helping someone who doesn't take money from big companies. You're helping a person who
                doesn't belong to either political party - someone who stands proudly as independent. Most of all, you're supporting someone who will work
                hard to protect you, your family, and your money. We need 3000 donations like this to get these policies on the ballot, so any support that
                can be given will go a long way.
            </p>
